# imBlogging
A simple blogging module for ImpressCMS 1 & 2 that works in conjunction with the imTagging module for categorizing your posts. You can set a future date for publishing to schedule when a post will be visible. And, beginning with version 1.2.0, you can set permissions on who can view posts and customize content for different groups of members.

## How to install
Copy the imblogging folder to the 'modules' folder. Then go to the 'Modules' tab in the administration panel and install the module.
